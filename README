README for bitter

Note! bitter is far from done. Do not expect it to do anything useful at the moment.

How to use:

Check out the code from git, cd into the new directory and compile the code:

  $ git clone git://github.com/flambard/bitter.git
  $ cd bitter
  $ erl -make

Start bitter by calling bitter:start/1 with the name of the torrent file as argument.

  erl> bitter:start("file.torrent").
